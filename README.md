# Credit_Risk_Analysis
## Overview
Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans. Therefore, multiple techniques were necessary in order to train and evaluate this model.

The machine learning methods used to evaluate credit risk were:
  * imbalanced-learn
  * scikit-learn
  * RandomOverSampler
  * SMOTE 
  * ClusterCentroids 
  * SMOTEENN
  * BalancedRandomForestClassifier 
  * EasyEnsembleClassifier
